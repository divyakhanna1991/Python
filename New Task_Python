1. Write python program to check Aadhaar card number is valid or not. If valid, display his details like name, company name.

import re

def check_aadhaar_number(aadhaar_number):
    pattern = re.compile(r'^\d{12}$')
    if not pattern.match(aadhaar_number):
        return False
    name = input("Enter name associated with Aadhaar card: ")
    company = input("Enter company name associated with Aadhaar card: ")
    
    return name, company
aadhaar_number = input("Enter Aadhaar card number: ")
details = check_aadhaar_number(aadhaar_number)
if details:
    name, company = details
    print("Aadhaar card is valid.")
    print("Name:", name)
    print("Company:", company)
else:
    print("Invalid Aadhaar card number.")


2. Given a list of N numbers, use a single list comprehension to produce a new list that only contains:
a) Even numbers
b) from elements in the original list that even indices
c) Print the Occurrences of an individual element
If the list[2] contains a value that is even, that value should be included in the new list,
since it is also at an index (i.e. 2) in the original list. If the list[3] contains an even
number, that number should not be included in the list since it is at an odd index in the
original list.

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
even_numbers_even_indices = [numbers[i] for i in range(len(numbers)) if i % 2 == 0 and numbers[i] % 2 == 0]
occurrences = {num: numbers.count(num) for num in set(numbers)}
print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)
print("Even numbers from elements at even indices:", even_numbers_even_indices)
print("Occurrences of individual elements:", occurrences)


3.Write python program to generate basic online shopping cart. This program will allow users:
a) to add items to their cart,
b) view their cart,
c) calculate the total price.

class ShoppingCart:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = {}
    def add_item(self, item, price, quantity=1):
        if item in self.items:
            self.items[item]['quantity'] += quantity
        else:
            self.items[item] = {'price': price, 'quantity': quantity}
        print(f"{quantity} {item}(s) added to the cart.")

    def view_cart(self):
        if not self.items:
            print("Your cart is empty.")
        else:
            print("Your cart:")
            for item, details in self.items.items():
                print(f"{item}: ${details['price']} x {details['quantity']}")

    def calculate_total(self):
        total = sum(details['price'] * details['quantity']
        for details in self.items.values())
        print(f"Total price: ${total:.2f}")

cart = ShoppingCart()
while True:
    print("\nMENU:")
    print("1. Add item to cart")
    print("2. View cart")
    print("3. Calculate total price")
    print("4. Exit")
    choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

    if choice == '1':
        item = input("Enter item name: ")
        price = float(input("Enter item price: "))
        quantity = int(input("Enter quantity (default is 1): ") or 1)
        cart.add_item(item, price, quantity)
    elif choice == '2':
        cart.view_cart()
    elif choice == '3':
        cart.calculate_total()
    elif choice == '4':
        print("Thank you for shopping with us!")
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please enter a valid option.")
