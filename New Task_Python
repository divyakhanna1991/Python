1. Write python program to check Aadhaar card number is valid or not. If valid, display his details like name, company name.
2. Given a list of N numbers, use a single list comprehension to produce a new list that only contains:
a) Even numbers
b) from elements in the original list that even indices
c) Print the Occurrences of an individual element
If the list[2] contains a value that is even, that value should be included in the new list,
since it is also at an index (i.e. 2) in the original list. If the list[3] contains an even
number, that number should not be included in the list since it is at an odd index in the
original list.
3.Write python program to generate basic online shopping cart. This program will allow users:
a) to add items to their cart,
b) view their cart,
c) calculate the total price.



1. Write python program to check Aadhaar card number is valid or not. If valid, display his details like name, company name.

}

aadhaar_number = input("Enter Aadhaar number: ")

    print("Invalid Aadhaar number")
else:
    if aadhaar_number in aadhaar_data:
        print("Aadhaar number is valid.")
        print("Name:", aadhaar_data[aadhaar_number]["name"])
        print("Company:", aadhaar_data[aadhaar_number]["company"])
    else:
        print("Aadhaar number not found.")


2. Given a list of N numbers, use a single list comprehension to produce a new list that only contains:
a) Even numbers
b) from elements in the original list that even indices
c) Print the Occurrences of an individual element
If the list[2] contains a value that is even, that value should be included in the new list,

original_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

new_list = [num for index, num in enumerate(original_list) if index % 2 == 0 and num % 2 == 0]

print("New list with even numbers at even indices:", new_list)
occurrences = {num: original_list.count(num) for num in set(original_list)}
print("Occurrences of each element:", occurrences)

3.Write python program to generate basic online shopping cart. This program will allow users:
a) to add items to their cart,
b) view their cart,
c) calculate the total price.

items = {
    'Grapes': 1.00,
    'Kiwo': 0.50,
    'Dragon fruit': 0.75,
    'Pineapple': 1.25,
}

cart = {}

    print("\nAvailable Items:")
    for item, price in items.items():
        print(f"{item.capitalize()}: ${price}")

    choice = input("\nEnter the item you want to add to cart (or 'done' to finish shopping): ").lower()
    if choice == 'done':
        break

    total_price += price
    print(f"{item.capitalize()}: {quantity} x ${items[item]} = ${price:.2f}")
