1. Write python program to check Aadhaar card number is valid or not. If valid, display his details like name, company name.
2. Given a list of N numbers, use a single list comprehension to produce a new list that only contains:
a) Even numbers
b) from elements in the original list that even indices
c) Print the Occurrences of an individual element
If the list[2] contains a value that is even, that value should be included in the new list,
since it is also at an index (i.e. 2) in the original list. If the list[3] contains an even
number, that number should not be included in the list since it is at an odd index in the
original list.
3.Write python program to generate basic online shopping cart. This program will allow users:
a) to add items to their cart,
b) view their cart,
c) calculate the total price.

ANSWER:-

(1)
aadhaar_details = {
    "123456789012": {"name": "John Doe", "company_name": "Example Corp"},
    "987654321098": {"name": "Jane Smith", "company_name": "Test Corp"}
}

def validate_aadhaar(aadhaar_number):
    if aadhaar_number in aadhaar_details:
        return True
    else:
        return False

def display_aadhaar_details(aadhaar_number):
    if validate_aadhaar(aadhaar_number):
        details = aadhaar_details[aadhaar_number]
        print("Name:", details["name"])
        print("Company Name:", details["company_name"])
    else:
        print("Invalid Aadhaar number")

aadhaar_number = input("Enter Aadhaar card number: ")
if validate_aadhaar(aadhaar_number):
    display_aadhaar_details(aadhaar_number)
else:
    print("Invalid Aadhaar number")

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Part a) Filter even numbers
even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]

# Part b) Filter even numbers from elements at even indices
even_indices_even_numbers = [numbers[i] for i in range(len(numbers)) if i % 2 == 0 and numbers[i] % 2 == 0]

# Part c) Print occurrences of individual elements
occurrences = {num: numbers.count(num) for num in numbers}

print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)
print("Even numbers from elements at even indices:", even_indices_even_numbers)
print("Occurrences of individual elements:", occurrences)
