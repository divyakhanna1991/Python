1. Write python program to check Aadhaar card number is valid or not. If valid, display his details like name, company name.
2. Given a list of N numbers, use a single list comprehension to produce a new list that only contains:
a) Even numbers
b) from elements in the original list that even indices
c) Print the Occurrences of an individual element
If the list[2] contains a value that is even, that value should be included in the new list,
since it is also at an index (i.e. 2) in the original list. If the list[3] contains an even
number, that number should not be included in the list since it is at an odd index in the
original list.
3.Write python program to generate basic online shopping cart. This program will allow users:
a) to add items to their cart,
b) view their cart,
c) calculate the total price.
