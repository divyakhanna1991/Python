1. Write python program to check Aadhaar card number is valid or not. If valid, display his details like name, company name.
2. Given a list of N numbers, use a single list comprehension to produce a new list that only contains:
a) Even numbers
b) from elements in the original list that even indices
c) Print the Occurrences of an individual element
If the list[2] contains a value that is even, that value should be included in the new list,
since it is also at an index (i.e. 2) in the original list. If the list[3] contains an even
number, that number should not be included in the list since it is at an odd index in the
original list.
3.Write python program to generate basic online shopping cart. This program will allow users:
a) to add items to their cart,
b) view their cart,
c) calculate the total price.

Answer:2 original_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

new_list = [num for i, num in enumerate(original_list) if i % 2 == 0 and num % 2 == 0]

print(new_list)

occurrences = {num: original_list.count(num) for num in original_list}
print(occurrences)
This comprehension iterates over the elements of the original list and their indices using enumerate(). It checks if the index is even (i % 2 == 0) and if the number at that index is even (num % 2 == 0). If both conditions are met, the number is included in the new list. Finally, it prints the occurrences of each individual element in the original list using a dictionary comprehension

Answer:3 class ShoppingCart:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = {}

    def add_item(self, item, price, quantity=1):
        if item in self.items:
            self.items[item]['quantity'] += quantity
        else:
            self.items[item] = {'price': price, 'quantity': quantity}

    def view_cart(self):
        if self.items:
            print("Items in your cart:")
            for item, details in self.items.items():
                print(f"{item}: ${details['price']} x {details['quantity']}")
        else:
            print("Your cart is empty.")

    def calculate_total(self):
        total = sum(details['price'] * details['quantity'] for details in self.items.values())
        return total

# Example usage:
cart = ShoppingCart()

# Adding items to the cart
cart.add_item('Shirt', 25.99)
cart.add_item('Pants', 35.99, 2)
cart.add_item('Shoes', 49.99)

# Viewing the cart
cart.view_cart()

# Calculating the total price
total_price = cart.calculate_total()
print(f"Total price: ${total_price}")
This program defines a ShoppingCart class with methods to add items to the cart, view the cart, and calculate the total price. You can create an instance of the ShoppingCart class and use its methods to interact with the cart.
