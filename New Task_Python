1. Write python program to check Aadhaar card number is valid or not. If valid, display his details like name, company name.
Ans 1.
aadhaar_details = {
    "123456789012": {"name": "John Doe", "company": "XYZ Corporation"},
    "987654321098": {"name": "Jane Smith", "company": "ABC Ltd"}
    # Add more Aadhaar card details as needed
}

def validate_aadhaar(aadhaar_number):
    return len(aadhaar_number) == 12 and aadhaar_number.isdigit()

def get_aadhaar_details(aadhaar_number):
    return aadhaar_details.get(aadhaar_number)

def main():
    aadhaar_number = input("Enter Aadhaar card number: ")
    
    if validate_aadhaar(aadhaar_number):
        details = get_aadhaar_details(aadhaar_number)
        if details:
            print("Aadhaar card details:")
            print("Name:", details["name"])
            print("Company:", details["company"])
        else:
            print("No details found for the given Aadhaar card number.")
    else:
        print("Invalid Aadhaar card number.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

2. Given a list of N numbers, use a single list comprehension to produce a new list that only contains:
a) Even numbers
b) from elements in the original list that even indices
c) Print the Occurrences of an individual element
If the list[2] contains a value that is even, that value should be included in the new list,
since it is also at an index (i.e. 2) in the original list. If the list[3] contains an even
number, that number should not be included in the list since it is at an odd index in the
original list.
Ans:- A
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# List comprehension to filter even numbers
even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]

print(even_numbers)

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# List comprehension to select elements at even indices
even_index_elements = [numbers[i] for i in range(len(numbers)) if i % 2 == 0]

print(even_index_elements)

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 2, 10]

# Element for which occurrences need to be counted
element_to_count = 2

# Count the occurrences of the element
occurrences = numbers.count(element_to_count)

print(f"The element {element_to_count} occurs {occurrences} times.")

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

selected_elements = [numbers[i] for i in range(len(numbers)) if i % 2 == 0 and numbers[i] % 2 == 0]

print(selected_elements)


3.Write python program to generate basic online shopping cart. This program will allow users:
a) to add items to their cart,
b) view their cart,
c) calculate the total price.
Ans:-3.
class ShoppingCart:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = {}  # Dictionary to store items in the cart
    
    def add_item(self, item, price, quantity=1):
        if item in self.items:
            self.items[item] += quantity  # If item already exists, increase quantity
        else:
            self.items[item] = quantity   # Otherwise, add new item with quantity
        
        print(f"{quantity} {item}(s) added to the cart.")
    
    def view_cart(self):
        print("Your Shopping Cart:")
        for item, quantity in self.items.items():
            print(f"{item}: {quantity}")
    
    def calculate_total(self, prices):
        total_price = sum(prices[item] * quantity for item, quantity in self.items.items())
        print(f"Total Price: ${total_price:.2f}")


def main():
    # Sample prices for items
    prices = {"Apple": 1.0, "Banana": 0.5, "Orange": 0.75, "Mango": 2.0}
    
    # Initialize shopping cart
    cart = ShoppingCart()
    
    while True:
        print("\n1. Add item to cart")
        print("2. View cart")
        print("3. Calculate total price")
        print("4. Exit")
        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")
        
        if choice == "1":
            item = input("Enter item name: ")
            if item in prices:
                quantity = int(input("Enter quantity: "))
                cart.add_item(item, prices[item], quantity)
            else:
                print("Item not found.")
        
        elif choice == "2":
            cart.view_cart()
        
        elif choice == "3":
            cart.calculate_total(prices)
        
        elif choice == "4":
            print("Thank you for shopping with us!")
            break
        
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please enter a valid option.")
